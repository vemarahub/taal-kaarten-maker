# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a secure authentication layer for the Dutch learning application that protects access to the learning content while providing a seamless user experience. The authentication system must be secure enough for public deployment without storing credentials in the codebase, and must support persistent login on mobile devices when installed as a PWA.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with a username and password so that I can access the Dutch learning content securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a login form before showing any learning content
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL grant access to all learning features
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent access
4. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect all routes to the login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want credentials to be stored securely outside the codebase so that the application can be safely deployed to a public repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application needs to validate credentials THEN the system SHALL use environment variables or external configuration
2. WHEN the code is committed to the repository THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any hardcoded passwords or sensitive authentication data
3. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL support configuration through build-time environment variables

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want my login credentials to be remembered on my phone so that I don't need to enter them every time I open the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL offer to save credentials locally
2. WHEN a user opens the app after saving credentials THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate using stored credentials
3. WHEN credentials are stored locally THEN the system SHALL use secure browser storage mechanisms
4. WHEN a user chooses not to save credentials THEN the system SHALL require login on each app launch

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log out of the application so that I can secure my account when using shared devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL clear the authentication session
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear any stored credentials if the user chooses
4. WHEN the session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to the login page

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication to work seamlessly with the PWA installation so that the mobile app experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is installed as a PWA THEN the authentication system SHALL function identically to the web version
2. WHEN using the installed PWA THEN the system SHALL persist authentication state across app launches
3. WHEN the PWA is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain the user's authentication state
4. WHEN the device storage is cleared THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about my authentication status so that I understand whether I'm logged in or need to authenticate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the issue
3. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation of login status
4. WHEN the session is about to expire THEN the system SHALL warn the user and offer to extend the session
