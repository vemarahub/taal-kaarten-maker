# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The HelloWereld Dutch learning application is experiencing a white screen issue when deployed to GitHub Pages at hellowereld.com. The application works perfectly in local development but fails to load in production. Users see a blank white screen with no visible content or error messages, though browser extension-related message port errors appear in console. This feature aims to systematically diagnose and resolve all deployment-related issues to ensure the application loads correctly for end users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting hellowereld.com, I want to see the Dutch learning application load properly, so that I can access the educational content and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to hellowereld.com THEN the application SHALL load and display the login page or main interface
2. WHEN the application loads THEN there SHALL be no white screen or blank page displayed
3. WHEN the application loads THEN all JavaScript and CSS assets SHALL be accessible and functional
4. WHEN the application loads THEN console errors SHALL be minimal and not prevent functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify the root cause of the deployment failure, so that I can implement the correct fix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN diagnostic tools are run THEN they SHALL identify whether the issue is asset loading, JavaScript execution, or hosting configuration
2. WHEN testing different URLs THEN the system SHALL determine if the problem is domain-specific or affects all GitHub Pages URLs
3. WHEN checking network requests THEN the system SHALL verify that all required assets return successful HTTP responses
4. WHEN examining console logs THEN the system SHALL distinguish between critical application errors and non-critical browser extension errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure GitHub Pages is configured correctly, so that the application can be served reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub Pages settings are reviewed THEN they SHALL be configured to serve from the docs folder
2. WHEN the CNAME file is checked THEN it SHALL contain the correct domain configuration
3. WHEN DNS settings are verified THEN the custom domain SHALL point correctly to GitHub Pages servers
4. WHEN HTTPS is tested THEN the site SHALL load securely without certificate errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate service worker and PWA-related issues, so that they don't interfere with basic application loading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service worker registration is disabled THEN message port errors SHALL be eliminated
2. WHEN PWA manifest references are removed THEN there SHALL be no failed resource requests
3. WHEN the application is built without PWA features THEN it SHALL load as a standard web application
4. WHEN service worker cache is cleared THEN old cached versions SHALL not interfere with new deployments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure asset paths work correctly in the GitHub Pages environment, so that JavaScript and CSS files load properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets use relative paths THEN they SHALL resolve correctly from the domain root
2. WHEN the base URL is configured for production THEN Vite SHALL generate correct asset references
3. WHEN assets are requested THEN they SHALL return HTTP 200 status codes
4. WHEN the HTML references assets THEN the paths SHALL match the actual file locations in the docs folder

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging information, so that I can quickly identify and resolve future deployment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application fails to load THEN detailed error messages SHALL be displayed to help diagnose the issue
2. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught by error boundaries and logged appropriately
3. WHEN assets fail to load THEN fallback mechanisms SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN console logs SHALL provide step-by-step loading progress information
