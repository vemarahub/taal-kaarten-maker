# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create diagnostic testing infrastructure
  - Build asset accessibility testing utilities that verify all JavaScript and CSS files are reachable
  - Implement network request monitoring to check HTTP response codes and loading times
  - Create environment detection logic to identify production vs development configurations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [-] 2. Implement comprehensive error detection and reporting
  - Create error boundary components that catch and display React component failures
  - Build global error handlers to capture unhandled JavaScript errors and Promise rejections
  - Implement network error detection to identify failed resource requests
  - Add user-friendly error display system with actionable guidance
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 3. Fix GitHub Pages configuration and deployment setup
  - Verify and correct GitHub Pages repository settings to serve from docs folder
  - Validate CNAME file configuration for custom domain hellowereld.com
  - Test DNS resolution and SSL certificate configuration
  - Ensure proper HTTPS redirect and security headers
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Optimize Vite build configuration for GitHub Pages deployment
  - Configure correct base URL and asset path resolution for production environment
  - Implement proper asset bundling and optimization for GitHub Pages serving
  - Remove or fix PWA service worker configuration that causes message port errors
  - Set up build process to generate correct relative paths for all assets
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 5. Create deployment verification and testing system
  - Build automated tests to verify successful deployment after each build
  - Implement cross-browser compatibility testing for the deployed application
  - Create performance monitoring to track loading times and asset delivery
  - Add deployment rollback mechanism for failed deployments
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 6. Eliminate service worker and PWA-related issues
  - Completely disable service worker registration in production build
  - Remove PWA manifest references that cause failed resource requests
  - Clear existing service worker cache that might interfere with new deployments
  - Configure build system to exclude PWA features until deployment is stable
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 7. Implement fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation
  - Create fallback UI components that display when main application fails to load
  - Implement retry mechanisms for failed asset loading attempts
  - Add progressive enhancement to ensure basic functionality works even with JavaScript errors
  - Build offline-capable error pages that work without network connectivity
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.3, 1.1, 1.4_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive debugging and monitoring tools
  - Build diagnostic dashboard that shows real-time deployment status and health checks
  - Implement detailed logging system that tracks application loading progress
  - Create user-facing diagnostic tools that help identify browser-specific issues
  - Add performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks in asset loading and rendering
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 6.4, 1.3_
